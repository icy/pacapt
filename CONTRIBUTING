Some guidelines

  1. Don't use tab or smart tab.
  2. Use 2-space instead of a tab
  3. Contribute to library file under `./lib/` directory
  4. Don't use `master` branch unless you need to fix bugs
  5. Use 'PACAPT_DEBUG=foo' where 'foobar' is a package manager
     (dpkg, pacman, zypper, ...) to print what 'pacapt' will do.
