DESCRIPTION

  An Arch's pacman-liked package manager for all Linux distributions.
  Actually this Bash script provides a wrapper for system's package manager.

  Instead of remembering various options/tools on different OSs, you only
  need a common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native
  package manager are ported; the tool only provides very basic interface to
  search, install, remove packages and/or update the system.

  Arch's pacman is chosen, as pacman is quite smart when it devides all
  packages-related operations into three major groups: Synchronize, Query
  and Remove/Clean up. It has a clean man page, and it is the only tool
  needed to manipulate official packages on system. (Debian, for example,
  requires you to use apt-get, dpkg and/or aptitude.)

  The tool supports the following types of package manager:

    pacman        by Arch Linux, ArchBang
    dpkg/apt-get  by Debian, Ubuntu
    yum/rpm       by Redhat, CentOS, Fedora Core

INSTALL

  Download the script 'pacman' and install it into /usr/local/bin.
  Example:
    $ wget https://github.com/icy/pacapt/raw/master/pacman -O /usr/local/bin/pacman
    $ chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pacman

  This script shouldn't be installed on Arch-liked system.

SYNTAX

  $ pacman <operation> <option(s)> <packages>

    -Qc <package>   show package's changelog
    -Qi <package>   print package status
    -Ql <package>   list package's files
    -Qm             list installed packages that aren't available
                      in any installation source
    -Qo <file>      query package that provides <file>
    -Qp <file>      query a package file (donot use package database)

                    (debian) See more at http://dragula.org/blogs/646

OPTIONS

    -f              force yes
    -v              be verbose
    -w              download packages but donot install them

NOTES

  To install a package from backports repository on Debian system:
              $ pacman -S foobar -t lenny-backports

  Similiarily, any further option which isn't recognized by getopts (1)
  can be passed to system tool.

  When being executed on Arch-liked system, the tool simplify invokes
  the system tool '/usr/bin/pacman'. So you would never install this tool
  as '/usr/bin/pacman', otherwise you may break your system!
