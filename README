NAME

  pacapt - An Arch's pacman-like package manager for some Unices.

DESCRIPTION

  An Arch's pacman-like package manager for some Unices.  Actually this Bash
  script provides a wrapper for system's package manager.

  Instead of remembering various options/tools on different OSs, you only
  need a common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native
  package manager are ported; the tool only provides a very basic interface
  to search, install, remove packages, and/or update the system.

  Arch's pacman is chosen, as pacman is quite smart when it divides all
  packages-related operations into three major groups: Synchronize, Query
  and Remove/Clean up. It has a clean man page, and it is the only tool
  needed to manipulate official packages on system. (Debian, for example,
  requires you to use apt-get, dpkg, and/or aptitude.)

  The tool supports the following package managers:

    pacman        by Arch Linux, ArchBang, Manjaro, etc.
    dpkg/apt-get  by Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
    homebrew      by Mac OS X
    macports      by Mac OS X
    yum/rpm       by Redhat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.
    portage       by Gentoo
    zypper        by OpenSUSE

INSTALL

  This script shouldn't be installed on an Arch-based system.

  Download the script 'pacapt' and install it into /usr/local/bin.

    $ wget \
        https://github.com/icy/pacapt/raw/master/pacapt \
        -O /usr/local/bin/pacapt

    $ chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pacapt

  If you have problem with Github's SSL certificate you may try

    $ wget \
        --no-check-certificate \
        https://github.com/icy/pacapt/raw/master/pacapt \
        -O /usr/local/bin/pacapt

  However this way isn't recommended unless you know what you're doing.

OPTIONS

    -f              force yes
    -v              be verbose
    -w              download packages but don't install them

NOTES

  To install a package from backports repository on Debian system:
              $ pacapt -S foobar -t lenny-backports

  Similarly, any further option which isn't recognized by getopts (1)
  can be passed to system tool.

  When being executed on Arch-based system, the tool simply invokes
  the system tool '/usr/bin/pacman'.
