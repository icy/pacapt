NAME

  pacapt - An Arch's pacman-like package manager for some Unices.

DESCRIPTION

  An Arch's pacman-like package manager for some Unices.  Actually this Bash
  script provides a wrapper for system's package manager.

  Instead of remembering various options/tools on different OSs, you only
  need a common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native
  package manager are ported; the tool only provides a very basic interface
  to search, install, remove packages, and/or update the system.

  Arch's pacman is chosen, as pacman is quite smart when it divides all
  packages-related operations into three major groups: Synchronize, Query
  and Remove/Clean up. It has a clean man page, and it is the only tool
  needed to manipulate official packages on system. (Debian, for example,
  requires you to use apt-get, dpkg, and/or aptitude.)

  The tool supports the following package managers:

    pacman        by Arch Linux, ArchBang, Manjaro, etc.
    dpkg/apt-get  by Debian, Ubuntu, etc.
    homebrew      by Mac OS X
    macports      by Mac OS X
    yum/rpm       by Redhat, CentOS, Fedora, etc.
    portage       by Gentoo
    zypper        by OpenSUSE
    pkgng         by FreeBSD
    cave          by Exherbo Linux
    pkg_tools     by OpenBSD
