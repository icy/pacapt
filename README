NAME

  pacapt - An Arch's pacman-like package manager for some Unices.

DESCRIPTION

  An Arch's pacman-like package manager for some Unices.  Actually this Bash
  script provides a wrapper for system's package manager.

  Instead of remembering various options/tools on different OSs, you only
  need a common way to manipulate packages. Not all options of the native
  package manager are ported; the tool only provides a very basic interface
  to search, install, remove packages, and/or update the system.

  Arch's pacman is chosen, as pacman is quite smart when it divides all
  packages-related operations into three major groups: Synchronize, Query
  and Remove/Clean up. It has a clean man page, and it is the only tool
  needed to manipulate official packages on system. (Debian, for example,
  requires you to use apt-get, dpkg, and/or aptitude.)

  The tool supports the following types of package manager:

    pacman        by Arch Linux, ArchBang
    dpkg/apt-get  by Debian, Ubuntu
    homebrew      by Mac OS X
    yum/rpm       by Redhat, CentOS, Fedora
    portage       by Gentoo

INSTALL

  Download the script 'pacman' and install it into /usr/local/bin.
  Example:
    $ wget https://github.com/icy/pacapt/raw/master/pacman -O /usr/local/bin/pacman
    $ chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/pacman

  This script shouldn't be installed on an Arch-based system.

SYNTAX

  $ pacman <operation> <option(s)> <packages>

OPERATIONS

  Query

    -Q              list all installed packages
    -Qc <package>   show package's changelog
    -Qi <package>   print package status
    -Ql <package>   list package's files
    -Qm             list installed packages that aren't available
                      in any installation source
    -Qo <file>      query package that provides <file>
    -Qp <file>      query a package file (don't use package database)

  Synchronize

    -S <package>    install package(s)
    -Ss <package>   search for packages
    -Su             upgrade the system
    -Sy             update package database
    -Suy            update package database, then upgrade the system

  Remove / Clean up

    -R <packages>   remove some packages
    -Sc             delete old downloaded packages
    -Scc            delete all downloaded packages
    -Sccc           clean variant files.
                    (debian) See more at http://dragula.org/blogs/646

OPTIONS

    -f              force yes
    -v              be verbose
    -w              download packages but don't install them

NOTES

  To install a package from backports repository on Debian system:
              $ pacman -S foobar -t lenny-backports

  Similarly, any further option which isn't recognized by getopts (1)
  can be passed to system tool.

  When being executed on Arch-based system, the tool simply invokes
  the system tool '/usr/bin/pacman'. So you would never install this tool
  as '/usr/bin/pacman', otherwise you may break your system!
